# The Adjacency Graphs Project
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/gerrymandr/adjacency-graphs.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/gerrymandr/adjacency-graphs)
## About
This is a project for managing Adjacency Graphs in python. There are package components for **algorithms** to generate adjacency maps from shapefiles, make **plots** from the result and **export** graphs. Once the package is [installed](docs/install_and_faq.md), you can quickly build an adjacency graph with one of our built-in algorithms as follows:
```
from adjacency_graphs.algorithms import TwoStepGraph

shp_path = '/path/to/shape.shp'
geoid_column_name = 'column_name'

my_graph = TwoStepGraph(shp_path, geoid_column)
```

## Quickstart

We recommend usage of Conda or virtualenv to work with this software. Directions
for setting up conda are at https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html

We'll proceed here with directions for conda for the virtual environment, but
we'll use pip to install our packages.

We don't have this package on PyPI yet.  To install, download or clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/msarahan/state-adjacency-graphs
cd state-adjacency-graphs
```

We include the environment definition that conda should create in the
environment.yml file. That's why we ask you to download the source first.

```
conda env create 
source activate adj
```

Note: on Windows, omit "source" in the line above.


The python package can then be installed by running the command

```
pip install .
```

That will install the `adjacency_graphs` package and all of the dependencies. To
see if the package has correctly installed, run

```
python examples/example_pipeline.py
```

## Contributing

There is a [guide](docs/development_guide.md) for first time contributors to
this project. This project is a fork (with history rewritten to reduce size)
from the original
[state-adjacency-graphs](https://github.com/gerrymandr/state-adjacency-graphs) and
would not have been possible without contributions from the
[Austin Gerrymandering Hackathon](https://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/blumberg/gerrymandering.html).
A full contributors list can be found
at [contributors.txt](docs/contributors.txt).
